Connection with MySQL

In package index of Python I can find the download link for Python interface to MySQL, but the interface just support the Python version 2.7.
I tried to find the solution for installation, but failed. And I uninstalled Python version 3.6 and reinstalled version 2.7.

After Python 2.7 installation I must set HOMEPATH in "Evironment Parameter Setting".

I installed MySQL interface for Python and in Eclipse I must apply the "MySQLdb" with menu Window -> Preferences -> PyDev -> Python Interpreters.
Later in "Python Interpreters" -> "Forced Builtins" I can find MySQLdb, it means that the interface has been set sucessfully.
